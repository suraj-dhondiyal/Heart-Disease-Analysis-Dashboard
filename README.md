🚀 **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)**

This project presents an interactive **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides insights into **patient survival rates, clinical indicators, and risk factors** to better understand heart disease outcomes.  

📌 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze **survival and mortality patterns** among heart disease patients.  
- Identify **age-related risks** and **clinical parameters** (serum creatinine, ejection fraction).  
- Evaluate the impact of **lifestyle and medical conditions** (smoking, diabetes, anaemia, high blood pressure).  
- Create a **dynamic, user-friendly dashboard** for healthcare insights.  

📊 Key Features of the Dashboard
✔️ **KPI Overview**  
- Survival Rate (%)  
- Average Age of Survivors  
- Total Survivals  
- Total Deaths  

✔️ **Age-based Clinical Analysis**  
- Serum Creatinine levels across different age groups  
- Ejection Fraction analysis by age  

✔️ **Risk Factor Impact**  
- Smoking, Anaemia, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure  
- Ribbon Chart comparison across groups  

✔️ **Interactive Slicer**  
- Gender-based filter to compare male vs female patients

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)  
- **Excel** (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)  
- **DAX** (Measures & Calculations)  


💡 Future Enhancements
- Expand with a **larger dataset** for deeper analysis.  
- Add **predictive modeling (ML)** for patient survival.  
- Deploy as a **real-time dashboard** using Power BI Service.
